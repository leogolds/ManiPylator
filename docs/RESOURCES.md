# Robotics Courses
 [This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY6RHB0yqJVasji1rwZAGYirD8zW1ipj-) excellent series of lectures from the [bioMechatronics Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@biomechlab), taking you from the basics to [surgery inspired use cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFvGwrENkeg&list=PLY6RHB0yqJVasji1rwZAGYirD8zW1ipj-&index=16&pp=iAQB). The lectures dealing with [rigid transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_HhBlQRp8&list=PLY6RHB0yqJVasji1rwZAGYirD8zW1ipj-&index=2&t=6s&pp=iAQB), [forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sd9fiinq5U&list=PLY6RHB0yqJVasji1rwZAGYirD8zW1ipj-&index=5&t=220s&pp=iAQB0gcJCY0JAYcqIYzv) and [inverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzaeS5LLhxA&list=PLY6RHB0yqJVasji1rwZAGYirD8zW1ipj-&index=7&pp=iAQB) kinematics are especially recommended.

# Demonstartions
[forward](https://robotics-explained.com/forwardkinematics) and [inverse](https://robotics-explained.com/inversekinematics) kinematics by [Robotics Explained](https://robotics-explained.com/) - excellent for building a conceptual understanding in 2D

# Quaternions
![Quaternion Use Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKd2lPjl92c) - shortform introduction to practical use of quaternions

![Quaternions - Freya Holmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMvIWws8WEo) - longform introduction to quaternions and their ergonomics vis-a-vie rotations

![SymPy Docs (Quaternions)](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/algebras.html) - easy to read, structured description of quaternions and their uses

![Converting between rotation matrices and quaternions](https://d3cw3dd2w32x2b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/matrix-to-quat.pdf) - derivation

![How Maxwell's Equations (and Quaternions) Led to Vector Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M12CJIuX8D4) - This is the story of best friends Peter Tait and James Clerk Maxwell and how their friendship with William Thomson (aka Lord Kelvin) and Tait's rivalries with Willard Gibbs, Oliver Heaviside, Heinrich Hertz, August FÃ¶ppl, and Edwin Wilson led to vector analysis via quaternions.
